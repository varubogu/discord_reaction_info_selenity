### Q: Can I analyze private messages (DMs)?

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Nothing happens when I enter a command
A: Please check the following:
1. Is the Bot properly added to the server?
2. Does the Bot have the required permissions?
3. Does `/reaction_members` appear in the command list when you type `/`?
4. If the Bot was recently restarted, wait a few minutes and try again

### Q: "Cannot read message" is displayed
A: The following causes are possible:
1. The message has been deleted
2. You or the Bot don't have access permissions to the message
3. The message URL or ID is incorrect
4. The target message is too old (exceeds Discord's retention period)

### Q: "Processing takes time due to large number of reactions" is displayed
A: When there are many reactions (100+) or many users (1000+), processing time increases. You can reduce processing time by:
- Using filtering parameters to narrow down the scope
- Breaking down into smaller ranges for execution

### Q: Timeout error occurs
A: Processing that exceeds 15 seconds will timeout. Try the following:
1. Use filtering parameters to narrow down targets
2. Wait some time before retrying (possible Discord API rate limiting)
3. Execute in smaller, divided ranges
